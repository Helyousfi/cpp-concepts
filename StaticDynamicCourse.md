# Header Files (.h or .hpp)
### Purpose: Header files contain declarations of functions, classes, variables, and other constructs. They act as an interface that other files can include and use.
### Usage: Header files are typically included in source files (.cpp), allowing those source files to access the declarations inside the headers.
```cpp
// mathutils.h
#ifndef MATHUTILS_H
#define MATHUTILS_H

// Function declaration
int add(int a, int b);
int multiply(int a, int b);

#endif
```
