# References in C++

## Overview

References in C++ are aliases for existing variables, providing a way to access and modify the original variable directly. Unlike pointers, references must be initialized when declared and cannot be null. They are commonly used for passing arguments to functions efficiently and safely.

This folder contains examples and explanations of various reference concepts in C++.

## 1. Basics of References

This section introduces references, explaining what they are, how to declare them, and how to use them to create aliases for variables. [View Code](01_basics_of_references.cpp)

## 2. References as Function Parameters

References can be used as function parameters to modify the original argument passed to the function. This allows functions to work directly with the caller's data. [View Code](02_references_and_functions.cpp)

## 3. References as Return Values

Functions can return references, allowing the caller to directly modify the original data returned by the function. This is useful in situations where returning a reference avoids unnecessary copying. [View Code](03_references_and_return_values.cpp)

## 4. Constant References

Constant references prevent modification of the referenced variable. They are commonly used for function parameters when the function should not modify the input. [View Code](04_const_references.cpp)

## 5. References vs Pointers

This section compares references and pointers, highlighting their differences and respective use cases. While both allow access to memory addresses, references provide a safer and simpler syntax in many scenarios. [View Code](05_references_vs_pointers.cpp)

## 6. Rvalue References (C++11 and beyond)

Rvalue references, introduced in C++11, allow you to bind to temporary objects (rvalues). They enable move semantics, which can significantly improve performance by eliminating unnecessary copying. [View Code](06_rvalue_references.cpp)
