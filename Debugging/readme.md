What is Debug Mode?
When you compile a program, you can choose different modes which affect how the compiler optimizes and manages the code. Debug mode is one of these options. Here's what it typically involves:

Debugging Information: In debug mode, the compiler includes additional information in the executable that helps with debugging. This includes information about the source code lines, variable names, and other details that make it easier to trace and debug issues.

No Optimization: The compiler does not perform aggressive optimizations in debug mode. Optimization can change the way code executes and can make debugging more difficult, so itâ€™s generally turned off.

Error Checking: Debug mode often includes additional runtime checks that can help catch errors that might be harder to find otherwise. For example, it might help detect buffer overflows or uninitialized variables.
