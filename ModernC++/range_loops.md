- introduced in C++11
- Syntax: for (auto element : container) where element iterates over each item in container.
- Automatic Iteration: Iterates over each element in a container (like arrays, vectors, lists) without needing an index.
- Read-Only or Modifiable: Use auto& element to modify the elements or const auto& element to keep them read-only.
- Simplified Looping: Removes the need for size() or boundary conditions, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.
